# 🧮 Calculator

A powerful C# calculator that supports mathematical expressions and functions.

## 🔍 About the Project

This project is a console-based calculator that can evaluate not only basic arithmetic operations but also complex mathematical expressions with functions. It is ideal for performing advanced mathematical calculations.

## ⚡ Features

- ➕ ➖ ✖ ➗ Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- 🧩 Supports complex mathematical expressions (e.g., `(5 + 3) * 2 / (4 - 1)`)
- 📈 Supports mathematical functions:
    - `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`
    - `log(x)`, `ln(x)`
    - `sqrt(x)`, `max(x, y, ...)`
    - and more!
- 🔡 Allows variable assignments for reusable calculations example:
    ```  
    a = 10  
    b = 5  
    a + b * 2  → Result: 20  
    ```
- 📏 Supports **absolute value expressions** using `|x|` notation example:  
    ```  
    |3 - 5|  → Result: 2  
    | -10 |  → Result: 10  
    ```

## 🛠 Installation and Usage
